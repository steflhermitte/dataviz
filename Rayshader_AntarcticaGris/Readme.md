# Rayshader Antarctica / Greenland

This visualisation uses [Rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader) to visualize Antarctica and Greenland with/without ice sheets. 

Scripts were written in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and data was downloaded from [Bedmap2](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/bedmap-2/) and [Bedmachine3](https://sites.uci.edu/morlighem/dataproducts/bedmachine-greenland/).

The folder also contains the final visualisations as a gif (switching transparency) and mp4 (showing rotating frames).These videos were made by combining both visualisations using Imagemagick and/or ffmpeg.
